### Introduction

This is the solution to the second programming assignment(Week 3) of the "R Programming" Module

The first function in "cacheMatrix.r" creates a special "vector", which is really a list containing a functions to set, get and invert a matrix. However, if the inverse of the matrix has been calculated, it will be cached and returned, without the need for computation (Refer to the second function for the same).
